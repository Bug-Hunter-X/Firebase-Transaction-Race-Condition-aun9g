# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common race condition that can occur when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  The issue arises when multiple clients concurrently attempt to update the same data, leading to unpredictable results.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to increment a counter using a transaction. If multiple clients execute this code simultaneously, there's a chance that the transaction will not correctly reflect the latest count, resulting in an incorrect value.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected approach using a more robust transaction handling mechanism that accounts for concurrent modifications. It includes better error handling and ensures data consistency.
