The following code snippet demonstrates a common issue when working with Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  The transaction attempts to update a value based on its current state, but it might fail if the data changes concurrently. This can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistent data. 
```javascript
// Incorrect transaction handling
firebase.database().ref('users/userid/count').transaction(function(currentCount) {
  if (currentCount === null) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return currentCount + 1;
  }
});
```
